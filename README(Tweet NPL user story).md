# EC 601 Project 2 Phase 2
### The user stories of my script "tweets_nlp.py" are, first of, retrieve recent tweets contents
### from a certain individual for further analyzing, secondly, do the sentiment analyzing of the
### tweet.txt, and thirdly, do the entity analyzing of the tweets in tweet.txt, and lastly, do 
### the syntax analysis of the tweet.txt. The mvp would be a simple analyzer for counseling use,
### when the therapists need to get the basic knowledge of the patients' recent mental condition,
### they can just use this analyzer app and look up the full analysis of the recent tweets of the
### patients and then get a general idea of their emotional statuses.
### So one type of users I would think of are therapists and psychologists who need to analyze
### their study subjects' or patients' mental and emotional conditions reflected through the social 
### media. The syntax analysis also helped to know the educational level of the patients or study
### subjects, as long as get a peek of their phrasing habbits, which would help duirng planning out
### the dialogs and conversations to make the patients feel relatable or comfortable, it will also
### be a good way to keep tracking of their recent interests and what are they doing/saying to get
### a better picuture of their persona reflections. It will need much more work to make this into
### a product that can be used by these users, but it is a good modular to start with and it can 
### already give needed outputs in "tweet_nlp.txt".
