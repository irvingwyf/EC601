# EC602 Project 2 Test Google NLP
### For Phase 1 (b), our goal is to practise and learn about Google Natural Language Processing API.
### In order to test out this NLP API's functionalities including syntax analysis, entities analysis
### , document sentiment measurement, entity_sentiment measurement and overall text classification, 
### based on the research I did relating to the python users applying the NLP in different ways, I 
### wrote the test program that will take the website urls and extract the text from the url pointed
### website, if cannot extract text, it will return the exception, otherwise, it will perform the NLP
### of the text extracted, then create the text file include the results.
### For this test run, I chose four different game review article websites and used NLP to run the 
### analysis of these four articles, it is working smoothly, and by breaking down the article into
### segments and words then analyzing and compare those with different libraries, categories and also
### dictionaries, then calculated and computed the results. My idea of doing this is not only trying
### out the functions of Google NLP API, but also trying to get a general idea of how is the game, is
### it good or bad or just getting a neutral review, and by comparing all four final results, I got 
### the conclution that this "the last of us part 2" game is getting a slighty bad review overall and
### the magnitude is pretty high summing up the positive and negative results and scores.
### I think it is an interesting way of using natural language processing to average different reviews
### from different perspectives and then sum up all different outputs to get a general purchasing idea
### and a standard level of expectation of the game (or any other merchands and figures).
### After doing this practice, I learned more about natural language processing and been amazed by the
### power of it, and I think it can be used in so many creative ways, not only for sentences or words
### review and paragraph analysis, it can also be used for teaching purposes since it can extend viewer
### knowledge to different dimensions and explore more about the things they thought they already get
### used to. Also it can be used to balance the biased ideas from both side of the scale and get a more
### neutral opinion or more objective perspective of things and events.
