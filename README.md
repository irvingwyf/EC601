### For Phase 1 (a), our goal is to practise and learn about twitter APIs.
### I wrote 5 test programs and tried in total 13 different test programs including the one given in class.
### I have tested the following functionalities including filtered-stream that contains methods to add, 
### remove, and retrieve rules from my stream; retrieving direct message including the status of the specific
### message indentified by ID; uses bearer token to authenticate and retrieve the specified Tweet objects by
### their IDs; the recent research that uses bearer token to authenticate and make a Search request; sampled
### stream that connects to the Sample stream endpoint and outputs data; get tweets that uses bearer token to
### authenticate and retrieve the specified Tweet objects by ID; get tweets with user context that implements
### the PIN-based OAuth flow to obtain access tokens for a user context request, then makes a Tweet lookup 
### request by IDs with OAuth 1.0a authentication of user context; user lookup that uses bearer token to 
### authenticate and retrieve the specified User objects by ID; get users with user context that implements the
### PIN-based OAuth flow to obtain access tokens for a user context request, then makes a User lookup request 
### by usernames with OAuth 1.0a authentication of user context.
### For most of the test programs they ran without issue, and the ones that need to implement the authentication
### will give the link when running using terminal and then by going to the link on browser, we can get the one
### time generated pin code, then by input the code inot terminal can access the further operation. However,
### also most of the API functions can be test and demonstrate once we got the access token, secret, consumer 
### token and secret, bearer token, there are some APIs that I cannot try out and test, for example the APIs
### that involving direct message, I am not sure if it is because my twitter account is newly applied and thus
### there is no direct message to test, or it is a general thing that certain API methods are not allowed to
### editing, delete or create direct messages due to lack of access.
### Over all, the twitter APIs uses IDs to label and track each and every operation in their system including
### every tweet has its own ID that can be used to locate and retrieve information about it by users or the
### administrator(assuming there is one which makes sense), and in order to visit or view or use any data, the
### Oauth will be used that require users to use their own tokens as the key to access these contents and also
### it can be used to reversely tracking down who visited certain things by locating and recognizing their
### unique tokens.
### Although I have heard a lot about twitter, this is the first time I tried to understand and even tryout some
### of the APIs and the functions within twitter application, and I am impressed.
